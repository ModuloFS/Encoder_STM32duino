# Encoder_STM32duino
Encoder library to use with the STM32duino framework.

This library is originaly copied from https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder
and was quick and dirty modified to be used together with the STM32duino framework.

It was slimmed down, so there are "only" 6 encoder possible with this library.
